Carrier,"The main focus of the #GrabYourWallet boycott is on retailers that do direct, monthly business with the Trump family, thereby enriching & emboldening a group of people we feel are extremely harmful to our nation. Carrier is an air conditioning company that worked out a deal with Trump that will enable it to keep approximately 1,000 jobs in the U.S. versus moving them outside the country. Senator Bernie Sanders worked on this deal as well prior to Trump becoming the president elect. Whether or not Trump executed the final deal in the way that's best for the American people, we acknowledge the U.S. jobs are incredibly important and that Carrier is not a company of the sort that enabled Trump's rise to power in any way. We are NOT boycotting Carrier at this time.",,,
Companies reflected by Donald's cabinet picks,"Effective boycotts give the companies on the list a positive, actionable way to have their names removed from the list, so adding the companies of the companies reflected by Trump's cabinet (i.e. ExxonMobil due to Tillerson's presence) would not, in our opinion, be productive. That said, many #GrabYourWallet participants have mentioned they will be avoiding the companies reflected by Trump's cabinet, and we certainly understand that decision. We've also added some of this information to the ""FYI Companies"" part of the list.",,,
Delta Airlines,"Over the 2016 Thanksgiving holiday, a passenger on a Delta flight went on a loud, pro-Trump rant that included asking the question, ""We got any Hillary b*tches on here?"" The flight crew in question failed to remove the passenger. Delta subsequently issued an apology including a statement that the passenger's values are not aligned with those of the company. The company also said it would take steps to ensure crew members know that in the future, such passengers should be removed. Then in late December 2016, an Arab American vlogger known for pranks claimed he was kicked of a Delta flight for speaking Arabic to his mom on the phone, an account that the Washington Post reported ""that the airline company and at least one passenger have contradicted."" (Delta took detailed passenger accounts upon landing and released a statement that the man, Adam Saleh, and his friend had been ""provocative"" including shouting.) Given that the focus of the #GrabYourWallet boycott is on retailers that do business with the Trump family and such incidents neither line Donald's pockets nor fund the rise to power of divisive politicians, Delta is not on the #GrabYourWallet boycott list.",,,
Facebook,"Given its massive international user base and high levels of daily engagement, the ways in which Facebook contributed to the distribution of propaganda / fake news during the election is of serious concern in our democracy and in the world. That Trump surrogate Peter Thiel is on the board of Facebook doesn't help matters much. After extensive discussions w/ Grab Your Wallet participants, Facebook is NOT being placed on the boycott list at this time for several reasons: (1) it's a vital tool for self-organizing, particularly Pantsuit Nation & its local chapters (2) Mark Zuckerberg has made formal statements acknowledging the problem of propaganda & fake news on the Facebook platform as well as a committment to addressing / fixing it, although these statements did not represent as strong a committment as we would have liked to have seen and (3) the media category (which is what FB is, a media outlet) is the one we are most conservative about adding new companies to the list b/c of the importance of free expression.",,,
Home Depot,"Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus endorsed Donald Trump for president but is no longer w/ the company and all Trump Home products on the site are marked ""Discontinued. We are no longer carrying this particular product.""",,,
PayPal,"Paypal co-founder Peter Thiel is an official Trump campaign surrogate but is no longer directly involved with Paypal as a company and does not sit on its board. While some boycotts of PayPal have chosen to focus on Trump supporter Carl Ichan being a stockholder in PayPal, publicly traded companies do not control who owns stock in them and according to the Wall Street Journal, Ichan owns only 3% of the company's stock - far from a controlling share.",,,
Niketown,"The athletic apparel company’s flagship Niketown store in New York City is located in a space owned by Trump, but as with other companies that lease from Trump â€” it's acknowledged that the lease may have been signed prior to the election. In addition, the #GrabYourWallet boycott's emphasis is on companies that realize a profit from doing business with the Trump family.",,,
Washington Post,"Amazon is on the #GrabYourWallet boycott list and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos also owns the Washington Post, however the Post is a longstanding institution and David Fahrenthold did some of the most important investigative reporting of the election. When polled 58% of #GrabYourWallet participants said the Washington Post should not be added to the boycott lis We do encourage people to subscribe to WaPo directly versus via the Amazon site.",,,
Urban Outfitters,"Richard Hayne is the CEO of Urban Outfitters, part of the URBN family of companies that include Anthropologie, Free People, BHLDN, and Terrain. Although records indicate that he did not donate directly to Donald Trump, he has donated to Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (who endorsed Trump) as well as former US Senator Rick Santorum (who acted as an appointed advisor to Trump during his campaign and helped sell Trump to portions of the Christian community.) The URBN family of companies originally appeared on the ""Shop These Trump-Free Alternatives"" portion of the #GrabYourWallet list, but upon learning of Hayne's political donation activities, were removed.
